# back up link register
# set link register to nlPrint
# set data to custom text
# branch and link to nlPrint
# restore link register when complete

# put a couple breakpoints in dolphin:
one at 8031c62c
and one before it at some point

when we hit the one before, put a breakpoint in HLE_OS.cpp at Line 57, that way we can see why it's not logging
Rough draft (not working):

START:
  lwz r30, 0x288 (sp) # original instruction
  
  # push and pop the stack
  stwu sp, -0x0050 (sp) #make space for 18 registers
  stmw r14, 0x8 (sp) #push r14-r31 onto the stack pointer

  mfctr r14 # backup the count register to r14

  lis r15, 0x8000 
  ori r15, r15, 0x9b34 # set r15 to nlPrintf
  mtctr r15 # set link register to nlPrintf

  # set data to custom text
  mr r15, r3 # backup r3
  lis r3, 0x8060 #set r3 to custom text

  bctrl # branch and link to nlPrint feels weird to do this with more to go after

CLEAN_UP:
  mr r3, r15
  mtctr r14

  lmw r14, 0x8 (sp) #pop r14-r31 off the stack pointer
  addi sp, sp, 0x0050 #release the space
